# CTIMER device PM

Driver under test: `drivers/counter/counter_mcux_ctimer.c`, plus the CTIMER clock gate
in `drivers/clock_control/clock_control_mcux_syscon.c` which the PM callbacks rely on.

Before the change this driver registered a `pm_device` whose `SUSPEND`, `RESUME` and
`TURN_OFF` actions were all empty: PM reported state transitions that had no effect on
the hardware at all. All six layers here are new, so every verdict below is about the
reworked driver.

## What is observable

Two things, because neither alone is enough.

**The AHB clock gate**, read out of the clock controller the way `tests/port` reads it
— `SYSCON->AHBCLKCTRL1[26..28]` / `AHBCLKCTRL2[21..22]` on MCXN, `MRCC_GLB_CCn` on
MCXA. Never out of a CTIMER register: a CTIMER register only answers while the block
is clocked, and whether it is clocked is the question. Gating that clock is the whole
of what `SUSPEND` does for power — from the counter API a stopped counter and a
suspended one are indistinguishable.

**The register image of an armed alarm** — `MR[0]` and its `MCR` interrupt enable.
This is what tells a restored CTIMER from one that came back from reset, and it has to
be the run-time image rather than the devicetree one: on every board here `prescale`,
`mode` and `input` are all `0`, which is also what a reset leaves. A case comparing
the devicetree configuration against reset would compare zero against zero and pass
without the driver restoring anything. `src/test_control.c` asserts that the armed
image is non-zero for exactly that reason.

On top of both, every layer asserts behaviour and not only registers: that the counter
advances, and that the alarm the consumer armed still fires. A CTIMER's functional
clock is selected by the *board*, not by this driver, so a register image that came
back perfectly while the clock mux did not would read as restored and still not count.

## Which action brings the block up

`TURN_ON` does nothing; `RESUME` configures. That is deliberate and
`test_device_resume_rebuilds_the_register_block` asserts it rather than assuming it.
`pm_device_driver_init()` runs `TURN_ON` and then stops short of `RESUME` when runtime
PM is about to own the device, so a driver that brings the block up in `TURN_ON` boots
it clocked while the core records it as `SUSPENDED` — the same shape as the
`lpcmp-boots-enabled-while-suspended` finding. `test_runtime_boots_without_a_consumer`
is the check that it does not happen here.

## The policy constraint

A running counter is stopped by any state that stops its clock, and it has no
completion event that could bound a shorter window. The invariant the driver keeps is
that the constraint is held exactly while `TCR[CEN]` is set: `counter_start()` and
`counter_stop()` take and release it, and so do the PM actions that stop and restart
the counter behind the consumer's back. Releasing it on suspend matters — without it,
one `counter_start()` would block Deep Sleep for the rest of the run even with no
consumer holding a reference. `src/test_system.c` asserts both directions.

Which states to declare is a board question, not an SoC one, which is why
`constraints.overlay` carries the list rather than the SoC dtsi: per MCX Nx4x RM Rev.
6_RC2 Table 336 CTIMER0 *can* keep counting in Deep Sleep and Power Down, but only on
a functional clock that survives them, and every board here attaches a PLL that does
not.

## Expected per layer

Verified on `frdm_mcxn947/mcxn947/cpu0`, station 1166.

| Layer | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `baseline` | PASS — the counter counts and an armed alarm fires |
| `device` | PASS — `SUSPEND` gates the clock, `RESUME` restores the armed alarm |
| `runtime` | blocked — see below |
| `system` | PASS — the constraint tracks `TCR[CEN]`, including across a runtime suspend |
| `sysmanaged` | PASS — the sweep's `SUSPEND`/`RESUME` round trip |
| `dpd` | PASS — the armed alarm comes back from a real Deep Power Down |

`dpd` was the layer whose outcome could not be predicted from the source. The CTIMER
functional clock select and divider (`CTIMER0CLKSEL`, `CTIMER0CLKDIV`) live in SYSCON
and are programmed by board init, not by this driver, so a register image that came
back perfectly while the clock mux did not would have read as restored and still not
counted. It does count: after the transition the gate is re-opened, `MR[0]` and `MCR`
are bit-identical, and the alarm the consumer armed fires.

`runtime` never reaches its own claims on this board, and not because of this driver.
The MCXN SoC dtsi enables a `core-domain` node of compatible
`power-domain-soc-state-change`, and that driver's `pd_pm_action()` dereferences
`pm_state_next_get()` unconditionally. In a build with `CONFIG_PM_DEVICE_RUNTIME` but
no `CONFIG_PM` — which is exactly this layer — that helper is a stub returning `NULL`,
so `pm_device_runtime_auto_enable()` faults during device init, before the console
UART is initialised: the board produces no output at all and the fault message has no
backend to reach. `pd-soc-state-change-null-deref` in
[../../docs/findings.md](../../docs/findings.md).

The layer's central claim is still observable, in `system`, which selects `CONFIG_PM`
as well and so gets past that fault: `ctimer@c000 at boot: suspended` with `gate=0`.
That is the whole point of doing the bring-up in `RESUME` rather than `TURN_ON`.
