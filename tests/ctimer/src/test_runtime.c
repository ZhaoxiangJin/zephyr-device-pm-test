/**
 * @file
 * @brief The runtime layer: the consumer owns the counter, and says so with a
 *        reference.
 *
 * This driver takes no runtime PM reference of its own. A counter runs for as long
 * as the application wants a time base, and there is no completion event a put()
 * could hang on, so wrapping each API call in its own get/put would stop the
 * counter the moment the call returned. The reference is the consumer's.
 *
 * What this layer is really here to catch is the boot state. pm_device_driver_init()
 * runs TURN_ON and then stops short of RESUME when runtime PM is about to own the
 * device, so a driver that brings the block up in TURN_ON boots it clocked while the
 * core records it as SUSPENDED -- green everywhere else, and wrong. This driver
 * brings the block up in RESUME for exactly that reason, and the first test below is
 * the check.
 *
 * Two tests. The first has to run first: it reads the state the device booted in,
 * and the second leaves it suspended.
