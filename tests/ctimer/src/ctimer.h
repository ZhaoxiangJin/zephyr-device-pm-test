/**
 * @file
 * @brief What every layer of the CTIMER case needs from the hardware.
 *
 * Two things are observed, because neither alone is enough.
 *
 * The first is the block's AHB clock gate, read out of the clock controller the
 * way tests/port reads it -- not out of a CTIMER register, because a CTIMER
 * register only answers while the block is clocked, and whether it is clocked is
 * the question. Gating that clock is the whole of what SUSPEND does for power, so
 * without it there is nothing to see: a stopped counter and a suspended one look
 * identical from the counter API.
 *
 * The second is the register image of an armed alarm: MR[0] holds the match value
 * and MCR its interrupt enable, and nothing else in the block carries them. This
 * is what tells a restored CTIMER from one that came back from reset -- and it has
 * to be the run-time image rather than the devicetree one, because on every board
 * here prescale, mode and input are all 0, which is also what a reset leaves. A
 * case that compared the devicetree configuration against reset would compare zero
 * against zero and pass without the driver restoring anything.
 *
 * A counter that advances is the third thing, and it is the control: it is what
 * makes "the gate is open" mean the peripheral works rather than that a bit is set.
