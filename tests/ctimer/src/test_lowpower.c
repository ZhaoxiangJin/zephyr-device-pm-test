/**
 * @file
 * @brief The sysmanaged and dpd layers: the device sweep across one transition.
 *
 * One file for two layers, because the sequence is identical and only the state
 * being entered differs -- and that difference is what separates the two claims. In
 * sysmanaged the sweep's SUSPEND and RESUME are all that happen, so re-opening the
 * clock gate and restarting the counter is enough. In dpd the CORE domain is power
 * gated: the whole register block comes back at its reset value, the SYSCON clock
 * gate with it, and nothing re-runs driver init -- so RESUME has to rebuild the
 * armed alarm from the image the suspend kept. dpd is the only layer that can catch
 * a driver with no restore path.
 *
 * What is asserted after the transition is deliberately behavioural as well as
 * register-level: that the counter counts and the alarm the consumer armed still
 * fires. A CTIMER's functional clock is selected by the board rather than by this
 * driver, so a register image that came back perfectly while the clock mux did not
 * would look restored and still not count.
