/**
 * @file
 * @brief The system layer: the per-device power state constraint.
 *
 * The CTIMER node lists the states that stop it counting in
 * zephyr,disabling-power-states (see constraints.overlay), and the driver holds a
 * policy constraint against exactly those states for as long as the counter is
 * actually counting. The window is not one API call -- a counter has no completion
 * event -- so the invariant the driver keeps is narrower and more useful than
 * "between start and stop": the lock is held while TCR[CEN] is set, which means a
 * runtime-PM suspend that stops the counter hands the lock back and a resume that
 * restarts it takes it again. Without that, one counter_start() would block those
 * states for the rest of the run even with no consumer left holding a reference.
 *
 * Two tests: that the lock matches what the node declares and appears only once
 * there is a running counter to protect, and that it follows the counter across a
 * suspend and a resume rather than being taken once and kept.
