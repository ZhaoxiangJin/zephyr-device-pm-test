/**
 * @file
 * @brief The device layer: the driver's PM callbacks, driven directly.
 *
 * Two tests, for the two halves of the callback. The first is the SUSPEND/RESUME
 * round trip, which owns the clock gate. The second is TURN_OFF/TURN_ON, which owns
 * the register block -- and since nothing in this layer really cut power to it, the
 * block is clobbered by hand so that the restore has something to put back. What a
 * real power cycle does is asked in src/test_lowpower.c under the dpd layer.
 *
 * Note which action is expected to bring the block up. This driver does nothing in
 * TURN_ON and configures from RESUME, so that an instance which boots SUSPENDED
 * under runtime PM boots with its clock genuinely gated instead of running behind a
 * PM state that says otherwise. The second test asserts that split rather than
 * assuming it.
