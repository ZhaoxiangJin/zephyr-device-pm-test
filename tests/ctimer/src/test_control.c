 * @brief The control: this case really does drive the CTIMER.
 *
 * Compiled into every layer. If this fails, no verdict from the layer under test
 * means anything -- which is the whole reason the baseline layer exists as a layer.
 *
 * Two claims, and the second is what makes the rest of the case possible: that the
 * counter counts, and that an armed alarm leaves a register image distinguishable
 * from a reset block. Every later layer tells "restored" from "came back from
 * reset" by comparing against that image, so a case where it is empty proves
 * nothing anywhere.
